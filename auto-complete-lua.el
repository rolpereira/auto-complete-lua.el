ANSI C function `sprintf`. The only differences are that the options/modifiers `*`, `h`, `L`, `l`, `n`, and
`p` are not supported and that there is an extra option, `q`. The `q` option formats a string between
double quotes, using escape sequences when necessary to ensure that it can safely be read back
by the Lua interpreter. For instance, the call

    string.format('%q', 'a string with \"quotes\" and \\n new line')

will produce the string:

    \"a string with \\\"quotes\\\" and \\

be negative. Option `q` expects a string; option `s` expects a string without embedded zeros.

     ("string.gsub" . "Returns a copy of `s` in which all (or the first `n`, if given) occurrences of
the pattern have been replaced by a replacement string specified by `repl`,
which can be a string, a table, or a function. `gsub` also returns, as its second
value, the total number of matches that occurred. The name `gsub` comes from
`Global SUBstitution`.

If `repl` is a string, then its value is used for replacement. The character
`%` works as an escape character: any sequence in `repl` of the form `%n`,
with *n* between 1 and 9, stands for the value of the *n*-th captured
substring (see below). The sequence `%0` stands for the whole match. The
sequence `%%` stands for a single `%`.

If `repl` is a table, then the table is queried for every match, using the first capture as the key.

If `repl` is a function, then this function is called every time a match occurs,
with all captured substrings passed as arguments, in order.

If the value returned by the table query or by the function call is a string or
a number, then it is used as the replacement string; otherwise, if it is **false** or **nil**,
then there is no replacement (that is, the original match is kept in the string).

Here are some examples:

    x = string.gsub(\"hello world\", \"(%w+)\", \"%1 %1\")
    --> x=\"hello hello world world\"

    x = string.gsub(\"hello world\", \"%w+\", \"%0 %0\", 1)

When called with **nil**
as its second argument, `next` returns an initial index and its associated
value. When called with the last index, or with nil in an empty table, `next`
returns nil.

If the second argument is absent, then it is interpreted as
nil. In particular, you can use `next(t)` to check whether a table is empty.
The order in which the indices are enumerated is not specified, *even for
numeric indices*. (To traverse a table in numeric order, use a numerical **for**.)

The behavior of `next` is undefined if, during the traversal, you assign
any value to a non-existent field in the table. You may however modify
existing fields. In particular, you may clear existing fields.
